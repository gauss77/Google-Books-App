# Google Books App

![BookApp](https://i.ibb.co/RgGZN0v/google-books-app.png)

Google books app is a result of implementing on my own what I have learned from the previous online library tutorial.

## What are the features of Google Books App

Google books app is a single page application that fetched data from GoogleBooks API. Users have the ability to enter a keyword in order to search for book topics they are interested in.

## What went well

Being one of the first react apps that I coded on my own, I was able to solidify my understanding of certain beginner react concepts.

## What are the challenges encountered

Challenges revolved mainly on putting together what I learned so far.

## Codebase differences

Although I referenced some code snippets from Stack Overflow and Google, I created this code base from scratch. Since I have significantly improved my React coding skills since developing this application, I made some minor enhancements to the codebase today. These improvements include utilizing optional chaining, template literals, and refactoring to make the code more readable.

## Future improvements

A fairly simple project that served its purpose to make me understand react concepts, there will be no future improvement in this app.
